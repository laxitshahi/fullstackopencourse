1. Always run npm commands where the package.json file is (root directory)
2. To enable auto refresh on index.js changes, create a .env file with "FAST_REFRESH=false" in it (no quotes)




Promises
- Axios' method get returns a promise

A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

- Promises can have 3 different states:
1. The promise is pending: It means that the final value (one of the following two) is not available yet.

2. The promise is fulfilled: It means that the operation has completed and the final value is available, 
   which generally is a successful operation. This state is sometimes also called resolved.

3. The promise is rejected: It means that an error prevented the final value from being determined, 
   which generally represents a failed operation.


Effect Hooks
Lets you:
    The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components. 
    Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM 
    in React components are all examples of side effects.

This makes it perfect for data fetching
